### Requirements:

Menu: a menu with first two pages + auto-generated categories menu with entries that redirect to
pages with users belonging to the selected category.

Extra: button to export all data in a JSON format.

### Notes:

- Source code should be published on github (github.com)
- Task should be completed with any modern JavaScript framework (Vue.js is preferred)
- Category tree shouldnâ€™t span more than three levels;
